# Nova

An accessible ebook reader for Windows, written in Rust.

## Formats

- **EPUB** (2 and 3)
- **PDF**
- **DOCX**
- **MOBI / AZW / AZW3 / PRC**
- **Markdown**
- **HTML / XHTML**
- **Plain text** — UTF-8, UTF-16 and Windows-1252
- **DAISY** — 2.02 (`ncc.html`) and DTBook XML

Tables are read out with their column headers ("Quarter: Q1; Revenue: 120"), images announce their alt text, nested lists use a different bullet per level, and DOCX footnotes and list numbering come through.

## Reading

- `Ctrl+T` — table of contents, opens on the chapter you're in, not the top
- `Ctrl+G` — go to line or page
- `Ctrl+F` / `F3` — find / find next
- `Ctrl+B` / `Ctrl+Shift+B` — add / manage bookmarks
- `Ctrl+H` / `Ctrl+Shift+H` — highlight selection / manage highlights
- `Alt+Left` / `Alt+Right` — navigation history
- `Ctrl+Home` / `Ctrl+End` — start / end of the whole book

Your position is autosaved and restored on reopen.

## Library

Books are only added when you add them: `Ctrl+D` for the current book, or "Add books…" in the library dialog (`Ctrl+L`).

Each book tracks a reading status (want to read, not started, reading, finished), favorite flag, and how many times you've read it. You can search, filter by status, sort by title/author/progress/recency, or arrange a custom order with Move Up/Down. Enter opens the focused book, Delete removes it.

Sorting ignores leading articles and sorts authors by surname ("The Hobbit" under H, "J.R.R. Tolkien" under T). A per-book "Sort as…" override covers the cases the heuristic gets wrong.

## Preferences (`Ctrl+P`)

- **Font family / size** — the font and size used in the reading area.
- **Chapters kept loaded** — how many chapters stay in memory, split before and after your position (2–100). Higher means smoother scrolling in both directions at the cost of memory.
- **Autosave interval** — how often your position (and, for library books, reading progress) is saved while reading. Closing the book always saves immediately.
- **Maximum recent files** — length of the File > Recent list.
- **Highlight color** — the background color drawn behind highlighted text.
- **Log level / retention** — how chatty the log file is and how many days are kept.
- **PDF table detection** — reconstruct aligned text grids as tables. Works well on real tables; can misfire on unusual layouts like two-column verse, hence the switch.
- **Automatically mark books finished** — reaching the end of a book sets it to Finished in the library.
- **Recognize re-reads** — reopening a finished book and starting over counts a new read.
- **Library list** — show the author before the title, and/or compact rows (title and author only — less to listen to per row).

## How it loads books

**EPUB.** The zip is opened once and read randomly: when a chapter is needed, only that entry is decompressed, straight out of the archive. Chapters load in spine order in a sliding window around your position, and ones that fall outside it are dropped, so a 2,000-chapter book costs about the same memory as a 20-chapter one. Jumping via the TOC or Go To loads from the target, not everything before it.

**Plain text.** Read once, decoded tolerantly (UTF-8 with or without BOM, UTF-16 either endianness, Windows-1252 fallback), then split into fixed-size sections that act as virtual chapters so navigation stays fast on 20 MB files.

**PDF.** PDFium is loaded lazily the first time you open a PDF, so it costs nothing otherwise. Each page is a chapter. Text is rebuilt into reading order from the raw glyph positions; aligned grids can be detected as tables. If the PDF is tagged, Nova reads the structure tree directly — figure alt text and real table semantics — instead of guessing.

**DOCX / MOBI / HTML / Markdown / DAISY.** Parsed once into titled chapters, split at headings, then read like everything else. MOBI handles PalmDoc decompression itself; HUFF/CDIC books go through the mobi crate.

**When files are bad.** Malformed markup falls back to a regex extractor instead of failing, absurdly deep XML nesting is caught before it can overflow the stack, and corrupt files get an error dialog, not a crash.
